React Hooks are a powerful feature that allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. The most commonly used hooks are `useState` and `useEffect`.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use `useState`:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button 
        onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)
      }>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
