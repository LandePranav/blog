Flexbox is a layout module in CSS that makes it easy to design flexible and responsive layout structures. It is particularly useful for aligning items within a container.

Here's a basic example:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}

.item {
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
