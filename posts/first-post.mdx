Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that every developer should understand. A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.

Consider the following example:

```js
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
console.log(counter()); // 3
